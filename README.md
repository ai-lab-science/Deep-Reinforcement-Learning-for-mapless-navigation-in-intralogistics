# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-mapless-navigation-in-intralogistics
This repository is for the paper "Using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Automatic Curriculum Learning for Mapless Navigation in Intralogistics".

The codes includes (i) Soft Actor Critic Algorithm (ii) Our algorithm of NavACL_Q.

## Some of our Results
Here we demonstraed some videos of our trained agent on successfully reaching goal state, i.e., the blue dolly.

Even with a moving target, the trained agent is able to react responsively to navigate to the goal.
